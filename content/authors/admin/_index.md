      Thesis on a polytopal representation of Schur symmetric functions through a Hopf algebraic isomorphism by Aguiar and Ardila. A polytopal representation for power sum symmetric functions is also obtained, and both are shown to be consistent with a polytopal representation of the elementary symmetric functions found by Aguiar and Ardila.

      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Combinatorics and Optimization at the University of Waterloo advised by Oliver Pechenik. Before that I studied at the University of Los Andes, where I completed a B.Sc. and a M.Sc. in Mathematics working with Carolina Benedetti. A constant theme in my work has been the exploration of discrete structures through their interaction with algebraic structures. Specifically, I have studied problems in the intersection of Schubert calculus, Hopf algebras, semigroup theory, polytopes coming from symmetric functions, and combinatorics.
