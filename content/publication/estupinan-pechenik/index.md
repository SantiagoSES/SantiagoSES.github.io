summary: We develop a new combinatorial rule to compute the coefficients of the projective representation theory of symmetric groups and cohomology of orthogonal Grassmannians. It is exponentially faster than Stembridge's rule in some families of structure coefficients. Our analysis also yields the first algebraic proof of Serrano's Littlewood-Richardson rule.
